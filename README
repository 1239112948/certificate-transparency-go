This is the really early beginnings of a CT Log client written in Go, along
with a Log Scanner tool.

You'll need go v1.1 or higher to compile.


Installation:

This go code must be imported into your go workspace before you can use it, you
can do that with:

  go get code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/go/client
  go get code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/go/scanner
  etc.


Building the binaries:

The go/merkletree package contains a cgo binding onto the C++ MerkleTree
library, so if you're using this go package (either directly or indirectly!)
you need to run the following command in the parent directory:
  make golibs

This will create any necessary .syso files and will place them directly into
the relevant go package src directories so that they will be automatically
picked up during cgo compilation.

To compile the log scanner run:
  go build code.google.com/p/certificate-transparency/go/scanner/main/scanner.go
